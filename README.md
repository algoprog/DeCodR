Semantic Code &amp; Repository Search

# Project Structure

In the `models` folder, we can keep our model implementations. In the readme files, we can also include our experimental results later. There are currently 4 examples of models we can use.

In the `code_search` folder, we can put our implementation for the "production-ready" inference API for code search.

In the `repo_search` folder, we can put our implementation for the "production-ready" inference API for repository search.
