# Code & Repo Search with Autoencoders

We can use this model implementation: https://github.com/shentianxiao/text-autoencoders

We can also experiment with TSDAE in Sentence Transformers: https://www.sbert.net/examples/unsupervised_learning/TSDAE/README.html. For example, we could add this loss to a multiple negatives cross-entropy loss, or use it as a standalone loss.
